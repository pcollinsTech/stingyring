        <p>
          We are passionate about bees and our environment. We love the ocean
          and love getting out to surf. For years I used conventional wax, then
          I started to worry about what it was made from and wondered what it
          was doing to me and the ocean. With that thought, the idea of Board
          Balm was born, a 100% renewable, biodegradable natural surf wax. Kind
          on you, kind on the ocean. Read more to find out why we were driven to
          create a natural alternative.
